# AnyShell

This repository provides a **simple way to gain shell access** on any hosting platform that supports **Dockerfile builds**. It includes a **web-based system monitor** and **Tmate for instant SSH access**.

## 🔹 Features

✅ **Web-based system stats** – Monitor CPU, RAM, Disk, and Uptime\
✅ **Tmate integration** – Get **instant SSH access** remotely (Docker deployment)\
✅ **Works on any platform** with Docker support\
✅ **Lightweight & easy to deploy**\
✅ **NEW: Vercel-compatible** – Deploy monitoring dashboard on Vercel serverless

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Full Features)
**Best for:** Full SSH access + monitoring

- **Fork the repo** on GitHub
- **Deploy it** on platforms like Railway, Render, Koyeb, or any Docker-supported host
- **Get SSH access** via tmate + full system monitoring

### Option 2: Vercel Deployment (Monitoring Only)
**Best for:** Quick serverless monitoring dashboard

⚠️ **Note:** Vercel is serverless, so SSH/tmate features won't work. You'll get system monitoring only.

**Deploy to Vercel:**
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/biswajr/AnyShell)

Or see [README.vercel.md](README.vercel.md) for detailed Vercel deployment instructions.

**For SSH access, use Docker deployment on platforms like:**
- Railway.app
- Render.com
- Fly.io
- AWS/DigitalOcean/Heroku
